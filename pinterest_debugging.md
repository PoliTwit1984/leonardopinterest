# Pinterest Integration Debugging

## Features Implemented
- Added Pinterest API integration with access token
- Implemented automatic board creation ("AI Generated Art")
- Added image upload to Pinterest functionality
- Integrated download and pin operations
- Added graceful fallback to local download when Pinterest fails
- Improved error handling and user feedback

## Testing Progress
1. Basic Setup
   - ✓ Pinterest access token configured
   - ✓ Pinterest API endpoints implemented
   - ✓ Board creation functionality added
   - ✓ Error handling for Pinterest API failures

2. Image Generation
   - ✓ Successfully generating images with Leonardo.ai
   - ✓ Images are being generated at 1024x1024 resolution
   - ✓ Ultra quality mode enabled
   - ✓ Loading states and user feedback implemented

3. Pinterest Integration
   - ✓ Graceful handling of Pinterest API errors
   - ✓ Fallback to local download when Pinterest fails
   - ✓ Status messages for both success and failure cases
   - ✓ Fixed send_file headers issue

## Known Issues
1. Pinterest API Authorization Error
   - Error: "Your application consumer type is not supported"
   - Status: 401 Unauthorized
   - Current Solution: Gracefully falling back to local download only
   - Next Steps: Need to investigate Pinterest API access requirements

## Current Test Status
- Image Generation: Working correctly
- Local Download: Working correctly
- Pinterest Upload: Failing with authorization error (graceful fallback working)

## API Response Tracking
- Initial board creation: Failed (401 Unauthorized)
- Error message: "Your application consumer type is not supported please contact support"
- Local download fallback: Working as expected

## Next Steps
1. Continue testing image generation and local download functionality
2. Investigate Pinterest API authorization requirements
   - May need different type of access token
   - May need to register application differently
3. Consider adding retry mechanism for transient Pinterest API errors
4. Add more detailed error logging for debugging purposes

## Recent Changes
1. Fixed send_file headers issue by using make_response
2. Improved error handling in download_and_pin endpoint
3. Added better user feedback for Pinterest upload status
4. Updated frontend to handle both success and failure cases gracefully

## Notes
- The application now successfully handles Pinterest API failures without disrupting the core functionality
- Users can still download images locally even when Pinterest integration fails
- Clear status messages inform users about the success/failure of operations
